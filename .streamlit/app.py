**Instructions:**
Please enter a brief summary of the patient's clinical scenario in the box below. Your input should include:
- **Symptoms:** A brief description of the patient's symptoms (e.g., fatigue, edema, shortness of breath).
- **Key Labs:** Relevant lab values (e.g., creatinine, potassium, GFR).
- **Additional Relevant Information:** Any other details you believe are important (e.g., medication changes, interval history).

The AI will use this information to generate a comprehensive narrative progress note in paragraph form. The note will have two main sections:
1. **Subjective:** A detailed summary of the patient's history and current complaints.
2. **Assessment & Plan:** A thorough evaluation of the patient's condition along with a clear management plan.

The final note will be written in the style of a seasoned nephrologist at the end of a visit.
